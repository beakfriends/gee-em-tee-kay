Player: so, i've actually been thinking a lot about [jittery]the break-up.
Player: i think...
->it was all her fault
    << set $blame = "hers" >>
    Player: yeah, i think i'm probably better off without her
    Player: she was making me really unhappy
->it was my fault
    << set $blame = "mine" >>
    Player: i messed up
    Player: real bad
    Player: but next time i'll do better
->we were both at fault
    << set $blame = "both" >>
    Player: we both made mistakes
    Player: i'll be alright!
Player: it's been good to talk to you!

Player: so PLANTNAME!
Player: hey...
Player: ...
Player: so you survived the whole week, huh?
Player: hardy little bugger, eh?
Player: ...
Player: man, it's been a [j]rough[/j] few days
Player: and i'm sorry for the times that i got mad at you
Player: it was never your fault
Player: ...
Player: um
Player: seeing you get a little taller every day has been
Player: well
Player: well it's been really positive for me
Player: in a silly way i guess
Player: kinda like
Player: we were getting through it together, y'know?
Player: and now here we are
Player: both still [wavey]trucking[/w]
Player: ...
Player: ...
Player: .       {delay=0.5}.       {delay=1.2}.
Player: so i've been thinking a lot
Player: about a lot of things
Player: i don't think i have it all worked out yet
Player: and i don't really know how to say the stuff that i [b]have[/b] worked out but
Player: ...
Player: well what the heck, here it is
Player: i think a lot of people think that they can control their lives
Player: and i mean, you can do things to [a]change[/a] it but...
Player: none of us are in control. not really.
Player: ...
Player: when you start a relationship, it's a bit like buying a [color=green][wavey]seed[/color][/w]
Player: and to turn that seed into a plant, you have to [wavey]nurture[/w] it

Player: so you do all the right things, you water it, you give it enough light
Player: and sometimes
Player: the plant still dies
Player: maybe a pipe breaks in your house and it gets flooded
Player: or maybe the neighbour burns bacon and sets the whole house on fire
Player: or an earthquake knocks your house down
Player: or heck, maybe the plant doesn't [b][j]want[/b][/j] to live with you
Player: maybe it just ups and leaves you
Player: leaves you with [j]nothing[/j]
Player: ...
Player: people think they can control their lives, but at the end of the day
Player: you can do [i]everything[/i] right and life will still find a way to [j]screw you over[/j]
Player: ...
Player: at least you stayed with me, huh?
Player: i've still got you, eh, PLANTNAME?
Player: ...
Player: ...
Player: anyway

Player: and you try your best, of course you do! you [b]want[/b] this lovely plant!
Player: and then, maybe, you get complacent
Player: you stop trying as hard
Player: i mean, heck, the plant looks great!
Player: it's tall, and vibrant, and it looks healthy
Player: and you start forgetting to water it
Player: and then you start forgetting to even [i]look[/i] at it
Player: and without even noticing, you'll turn around one day and find out...
Player: you find out that you've [j]killed[/j] this thing that you loved
Player: and now it's gone and you have to [j]live with what you did[/j]
Player: ...
Player: you can plan your whole life with someone
Player: feel like you know exactly where you are, that you're in control of everything
Player: and still manage to get it wrong
Player: you can still end up alone
Player: ...
Player: it's been hard, but i think i'm starting to come to terms with what i've done
Player: i've learned a lot, and the person i was at the end of that relationship...
Player: i don't want to be him anymore
Player: i think that i can take the lessons i learned and change myself
Player: for the better
Player: you're looking mighty fine for a start, PLANTNAME!
Player: if i do say so myself
Player: so you know, maybe it's not so bad
Player: this is a [wavey]fresh start[/w]
Player: and next time i'll do better

Player: but at the end of the day, there's only so much you can [i]change[/i] about this plant
Player: you can't take a seed for a [color=red]rose[/c] and grow a [color=yellow]daffodil[/c] from it.
Player: there's so much you can affect though!
Player: from that seed, there is the potential for an [wavey]infinite[/i] number of possible plants!
Player: well maybe not [j][b]infinite[/j][/b]
Player: but you know what i mean!
Player: all different shapes! all different sizes!
Player: ...
Player: but if you want a daffodil...
Player: you need a daffodil seed
Player: ...
Player: sometimes
Player: people just don't [j]fit[/j] well enough together
Player: they're just... not compatible
Player: this thing with chris...
Player: we both made mistakes
Player: we both didn't listen as hard as we could have done
Player: but at the same time...
Player: maybe it just wasn't meant to be
Player: i certainly can't blame her for that
Player: and i'm slowly learning to not blame myself for that either
Player: i can acknowledge my mistakes without beating myself up over something that really, in the end...
Player: i had no control over
Player: ...
Player: so thank you for showing me that, PLANTNAME
Player: just because something has [wavey]infinite potential...[/w]
Player: doesn't mean that you can change everything about it

Player: ...
Player: well
Player: i don't how much all that stuff matters
Player: i mean it definitely doesn't matter to you lmaooooo
Player: but it was good to get it out there
Player: heck, it's been good to get [b]all[/b] this stuff out there
Player: you've made a bad week a lot better
Player: thanks, buddy
Player: ...
Player: my furniture arrives tomorrow
Player: and that presents me with a tough decision, PLANTNAME
Player: if i keep you, i'll probably have to get rid of something else
Player: it's gonna be hard to fit all my stuff in anyway, without you taking up roughly [wavey]one ninth[/w] of my floor space
Player: but at the same time...
Player: maybe it's time to say goodbye?
Player: ...
Player: well...
Player: what do [i]you[/i] think?
Player: ...
Player: ...
Player: yeah, that's pretty much what i expected
Player: ...
Player: ...

<<keepPlant>>
Player: so i'm just running through all the things that are arriving tomorrow
Player: and i really gotta ask myself
Player: how many of them actually made me feel... good?
Player: sure, some of it's really [wavey]comfy[/w]
Player: but a lot of it's coming from our old place
Player: ...
Player: but with you in here with me
Player: it's gonna feel [wavey]different[/w]
Player: heh
Player: it's like i'm sowing the seeds of change
Player: ...{delay=0.5}?
Player: nah that's dumb

<<chuckPlant>>
Player: PLANTNAME...
Player: i gotta be real with you
Player: you changed my life
Player: and not like in some awful [a]"going to africa for a week [b]changed my life[/b]!!!"[/a] kinda way
Player: i'll be the first to admit i'm a pretentious sod
Player: but i draw a line there
Player: ...
Player: when i first walked into this room and it was just so [jittery]empty[/j]
Player: i could just feel that i...
Player: i could just tell, i...
Player: ...
Player: in a very real way, PLANTNAME, you saved me
Player: and i will never forget you
Player: ...
Player: i've given you so much of my pain
Player: and now you can take it away with you
Player: ...
Player: i'll plant you somewhere, out there
Player: and maybe you can make someone else's day?
Player: maybe someone will be feeling alone
Player: and they'll see how tall and bright you are
Player: and they'll see what a good listener you are!
Player: ...
Player: i like that idea
Player: thank you, PLANTNAME
Player: thank you for everything
